Beyond Journey's End

2
01:29.980 --> 01:39.740
At the northernmost end of the continent,
I arrived at the place that
the people of this world call heaven:
Aureole, the land where souls rest.

3
01:39.740 --> 01:48.000
Many souls gather there, and I spoke with
friends who once fought alongside me.
â€”Flamme the Legendary Mage

4
01:59.800 --> 02:00.850
Frieren.

5
02:08.440 --> 02:10.560
The royal capital's in sight.

6
02:10.560 --> 02:13.440
The adventurers are making 
their triumphant return.

7
02:13.440 --> 02:15.230
They must be celebrating in the city.

02:17.740 --> 02:20.320
We'll have to look for work once we're back.

02:20.820 --> 02:22.990
You're already thinking about that?

02:23.410 --> 02:24.990
It's important, after all.

02:24.990 --> 02:28.080
We've defeated the Demon King, 
but it's not over.

02:28.910 --> 02:31.170
We have the whole rest 
of our lives ahead of us.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.750
Work, huh?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.920
I'd like something where 
I can drink on the job.

02:36.210 --> 02:37.510
Aren't you a priest?

02:40.180 --> 02:41.800
I suppose you're right.

02:43.930 --> 02:51.440
Frieren, the life ahead of you will surely 
be much longer than we can imagine.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.610
Perhaps.

03:01.990 --> 03:07.950
Beyond Journey's End

03:30.770 --> 03:32.480
Himmel the Hero,

03:32.850 --> 03:35.980
Eisen the Warrior, Heiter the Priest,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.730
and Frieren the Mage.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.910
Thank you for defeating the Demon King.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.990
Now our world will enter an age of peace.

04:02.970 --> 04:06.930
The king's going to erect 
statues of us in the plaza.

04:07.350 --> 04:14.310
I'm not sure they'll be able to faithfully 
recreate my handsome looks, though.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.900
How self-serving of him.

04:16.900 --> 04:20.480
He only gave us ten copper coins 
when we left on our adventure.

04:22.110 --> 04:26.780
Now, now, Frieren. 
Tonight, we drink for free.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.740
I'd say we're even, wouldn't you?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.450
You corrupt priest.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.210
It's over.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.210
Yeah.

04:42.970 --> 04:45.590
This is the end of our adventure.

04:46.430 --> 04:47.930
It's been ten years, huh?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.970
We've been through a lot.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.390
The day we departed...

04:54.020 --> 04:58.480
Himmel and Eisen were nearly executed 
for speaking rudely to the king.

04:54.730 --> 04:55.810
Kill them.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.480
We'll give them a talking to.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.480
Shall we lick your boots?

04:58.770 --> 05:01.900
One misstep, and our adventure 
would've ended there.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.530
Sometimes, Heiter was too 
hungover to do anything.

05:10.830 --> 05:14.500
You're as pallid as an undead. 
Are you all right?

05:14.500 --> 05:15.460
No.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.620
No, huh?

05:17.120 --> 05:19.380
It was a weekly occurrence.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.380
I, on the other hand, was exceptional.

05:21.630 --> 05:25.220
We thought about leaving you behind 
when that mimic tried to eat you.

05:25.220 --> 05:28.390
Seriously? We told her it was a trap.

05:26.630 --> 05:30.100
It's dark and scary in here!

05:28.390 --> 05:30.100
Why don't we leave the elf behind?

05:34.730 --> 05:38.350
We have nothing but terrible memories.

05:39.690 --> 05:41.360
But I had fun.

05:41.860 --> 05:45.240
I'm glad I got to adventure with all of you.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.240
Likewise.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.990
It was a mere ten-year adventure.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.700
"A mere ten-year adventure"?

05:51.700 --> 05:54.120
But that's an entire decade 
we spent adventuring together.

05:54.450 --> 05:58.080
Look at Heiter. He's turned into an old man.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.630
That's rude.

05:59.630 --> 06:01.170
He always looked like that.

06:01.170 --> 06:02.460
That's rude.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.220
It's nearly time.

06:19.270 --> 06:21.690
The Era Meteor Shower, was it?

06:22.310 --> 06:25.570
It happens once every fifty years.

06:26.610 --> 06:29.490
Perfect for marking the 
start of an era of peace.

06:32.570 --> 06:34.240
They're beautiful.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.620
The view's not so good 
from inside the city, though.

06:36.620 --> 06:39.750
I'm having a moment over here. 
Don't spoil the mood.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.250
Next time, then.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.970
I know a place where you 
can see them more clearly.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.510
I'll take you there in fifty years.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.390
What?

06:54.390 --> 06:56.720
It's nothing.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.730
You're right. Let's go see them together.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.000
Well, I should go.

07:26.550 --> 07:28.260
What are you going to do now?

07:28.800 --> 07:31.340
I'm going to continue collecting spells.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.850
I plan to travel around the central lands 
for the next hundred years or so.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.220
I'll stop by once in a while.

07:42.310 --> 07:44.940
I can't understand what 
being an elf must be like.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.610
Seriously, how long has she been around?

07:48.360 --> 07:53.610
To her, fifty or even a hundred years 
might be a trifling thing.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.920
Shadow dragon horns?

08:46.210 --> 08:48.590
We don't have those here.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.920
Haven't seen a shadow dragon 
in twenty or thirty years.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.930
I see. That's no good. 
I need one for summoning.

08:59.510 --> 09:05.020
<i>Come to think of it, I think Himmel still has
the horn we got at the Demon King's castle.</i>

09:05.600 --> 09:08.940
It's exuding some kind of evil aura.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.900
It's not harmful to people, is it?

09:10.900 --> 09:12.030
I don't know.

09:12.030 --> 09:13.900
You don't know, huh?

09:14.610 --> 09:17.320
<i>It's nearly time for the 
Era Meteor Shower again.</i>

09:17.320 --> 09:18.910
<i>I'll pick the horn up when I visit him.</i>

09:24.910 --> 09:28.330
<i>The city's changed quite a bit 
since I was last here.</i>

09:42.720 --> 09:44.890
It should be around here.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.940
Frieren?

09:47.890 --> 09:48.730
Himmel...

09:55.610 --> 09:56.950
You're so old.

09:56.950 --> 09:58.360
Do you have to put it so bluntly?

10:00.780 --> 10:04.620
I'm still pretty handsome 
at this age, though, aren't I?

10:06.040 --> 10:10.880
It's been fifty years. 
You look the same as you ever did.

10:11.750 --> 10:15.090
I thought I'd never see you again.

10:17.470 --> 10:19.380
The Era Meteor Shower, huh?

10:19.680 --> 10:21.550
That brings back memories.

10:21.550 --> 10:24.720
About that thing we looted from 
the Demon King's castle...

10:24.720 --> 10:26.770
You mean the shadow dragon horn?

10:27.100 --> 10:30.020
I've never forgotten about it.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.020
My cabinet's been exuding 
an evil aura all this time.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.780
Sorry, I think.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.240
You could've stashed it 
in a shed or something.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.910
I couldn't do that.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.830
You may not have thought much 
of leaving it with me,

10:51.830 --> 10:57.420
but to me, it was a treasure 
entrusted to me by a dear friend.

10:57.420 --> 11:01.180
I had to return it to you someday.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.730
It's not that big a deal.

11:32.580 --> 11:33.880
Himmel, are you ready yet?

11:34.580 --> 11:37.460
You're bald, anyway. There's no point 
in fussing over your appearance.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.880
There are things we bald men 
are particular about.

11:47.930 --> 11:51.520
Now, shall we go see the Era Meteor Shower?

11:59.690 --> 12:02.490
You've become rather dignified, Heiter.

12:02.490 --> 12:04.410
I'm a bishop of the holy city, after all.

12:04.700 --> 12:07.830
You haven't changed at all.

12:07.830 --> 12:09.660
Don't pat my head.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.500
Eisen, you haven't changed much.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.590
Is that how I seem to you?

12:16.590 --> 12:18.000
I would expect as much from a dwarf.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.470
So, where's this place where we can 
see the meteor shower clearly?

12:22.380 --> 12:24.430
We're going there now?

12:24.430 --> 12:28.430
It's a bit early to see the 
Era Meteor Shower, isn't it?

12:28.430 --> 12:32.520
Yeah. It's about a week's walk from here.

12:32.770 --> 12:35.020
It's that far away?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.610
Unbelievable.

12:36.610 --> 12:39.020
You should be kinder to the elderly.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.860
This brings back memories.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.030
Traveling together like this makes me 
feel like we've returned to those days.

12:52.450 --> 12:55.040
We journeyed to all sorts of places.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.050
Everything seemed so brilliant and new.

13:25.860 --> 13:30.910
And you were always there 
in those beautiful memories.

13:34.080 --> 13:39.750
I'd been looking forward to the day 
when we'd all be together again.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.380
Thank you, Frieren.

13:43.300 --> 13:48.680
Because of you, I had this delightful 
adventure at the very end.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.330
They're beautiful.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.860
I think Himmel was happy.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.820
You think so?

14:54.780 --> 14:57.910
She was one of Mr. Himmel's companions?

14:58.250 --> 15:00.420
I haven't seen her look sad once today.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.630
How heartless.

15:03.630 --> 15:07.300
Now, now! We're not wearing 
sad expressions, either.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.840
Show some respect, Bishop!

15:08.840 --> 15:10.050
You're heartless!

15:11.680 --> 15:13.090
You wound me.

15:37.040 --> 15:41.370
It's not like I knew anything about him.

15:53.470 --> 15:57.350
We only traveled together 
for a mere ten years.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.820
I knew human lives were short, but...

16:10.070 --> 16:14.860
Why didn't I try to get to know him better?

16:23.960 --> 16:26.170
Don't pat my head.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.970
I should return to the holy city.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.730
Let me get a good look at your faces.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.600
This will probably be 
the last time I see you.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.360
Are you unwell?

16:48.730 --> 16:51.110
My years of drinking have caught up to me.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.860
It's divine punishment.

16:54.360 --> 16:58.990
If you're ever in the holy city, 
offer a drink at my grave.

17:00.870 --> 17:03.540
Heiter, you're not afraid of dying?

17:05.670 --> 17:09.460
We're the party of adventurers 
that saved the world.

17:09.460 --> 17:13.210
We'll surely be living the good life 
in Heaven after death.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.930
That's the whole reason 
I fought alongside you.

17:17.930 --> 17:19.510
You corrupt priest.

17:21.770 --> 17:23.480
If you'll excuse me.

17:31.690 --> 17:34.690
I should get going, too.

17:35.490 --> 17:37.700
You're off to collect more spells?

17:37.700 --> 17:39.530
There's that, too,

17:40.410 --> 17:43.410
but I want to learn more about humans.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.500
I see.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.920
So I wanted to ask you something.

17:49.920 --> 17:55.010
Seeing as how I'm a mage, having a powerful 
warrior to defend me would be a huge help.

17:55.010 --> 17:56.720
Give me a break.

17:57.050 --> 17:59.970
I'm too old to swing an axe now.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.810
Don't make that face, Frieren.

18:06.180 --> 18:11.110
Surprisingly, life slows down 
once you've lost your vigor.

18:12.940 --> 18:13.860
I see.

18:14.650 --> 18:16.860
I'll see you later, Eisen.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.860
Yeah. See you later.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.940
Episode 1: The Journey's End

19:00.410 --> 19:02.410
That's the tree I saw earlier.

19:02.410 --> 19:04.280
I always get lost in these woods.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.580
Where am I?

19:05.830 --> 19:10.290
20 years after the death of Himmel the Hero,
on the outskirts of the holy city of Strahl in the central lands

19:10.960 --> 19:13.040
Are you looking for something?

19:18.340 --> 19:20.050
Is something the matter?

19:20.930 --> 19:24.930
I'm looking for the home 
of a man named Heiter.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.600
Then you're a visitor.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.190
You're still alive, you corrupt priest?

19:34.610 --> 19:38.230
Turns out it's harder than I thought 
to make a stylish exit.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.990
I brought some liquor to offer at your grave.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.610
Would you like a drink?

19:42.610 --> 19:44.950
I gave up drinking.

19:44.950 --> 19:45.780
I see.

19:46.450 --> 19:51.370
I doubt the Goddess will forgive you 
even if you clean up your act now.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.470
Thank you.

20:05.510 --> 20:06.600
Who is she?

20:06.890 --> 20:08.470
Her name is Fern.

20:08.470 --> 20:11.810
She's a war orphan from the southern lands.

20:13.230 --> 20:18.400
It's not like you to 
volunteer to help people.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.070
You're not Himmel, after all.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.910
Frieren, why did you come to visit me?

20:25.910 --> 20:28.080
I was in the holy city 
picking up some things.

20:28.580 --> 20:32.410
I've been trying to get to know the people 
I meet on my travels as much as possible.

20:33.410 --> 20:38.420
And I owe you a lot, so I came to 
repay my debts before you died.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.180
In that case, I have a request.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.260
Will you take on an apprentice?

20:49.100 --> 20:53.020
Fern has potential as a mage.

20:53.020 --> 20:56.150
Will you take her with you on your travels?

20:59.020 --> 21:02.150
I'm sorry, Heiter. 
That's the one thing I can't do.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.110
She'd only get in my way.

21:05.410 --> 21:09.280
You know how often 
apprentice mages die in battle.

21:09.990 --> 21:13.660
I'm not sending a child my friend 
asked me to look after to her death.

21:16.790 --> 21:20.590
I see. Then I have another request.

21:26.180 --> 21:29.640
This was unearthed from 
the tomb of Ewig the Sage.

21:30.260 --> 21:37.440
This grimoire is said to contain lost 
spells of resurrection and immortality.

21:37.770 --> 21:41.070
I find it hard to believe 
such magic really exists.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.070
That's part of why I'd like you to decipher it.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.570
Can you do that?

21:47.160 --> 21:49.370
It's written in code using pictures.

21:49.370 --> 21:52.160
The people of this era 
really liked this kind of thing.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.950
I could do it, given five or six years.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.170
I see.

21:57.710 --> 22:00.750
But why do you want this deciphered?

22:00.750 --> 22:03.420
I thought you weren't afraid of dying.

22:03.420 --> 22:05.550
I have two reasons.

22:06.010 --> 22:10.550
The first is that I when I said that, 
I was just putting on a brave face for you.

22:10.800 --> 22:14.930
The second is that I'm now more 
afraid of dying than I was before.

22:15.810 --> 22:24.110
Even if I can't achieve immortality, 
I'd like a bit more time.

22:28.150 --> 22:32.370
Besides, the holy texts tell us 
to live healthy lives.

22:32.370 --> 22:35.580
A long life is the ultimate 
expression of that, Frieren.

22:35.580 --> 22:37.250
You corrupt priest.

22:39.420 --> 22:46.340
Also, in your spare time, 
will you teach Fern magic?

22:46.710 --> 22:50.970
As a priest, I don't have that knowledge.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.060
I could do that.

23:01.730 --> 23:02.900
There you are.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.650
I've been looking everywhere for you.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.740
Do you always train in the woods?

23:09.110 --> 23:13.320
Was finding me difficult even for you?

23:13.910 --> 23:18.120
Mr. Heiter often tells me 
I'm practically invisible.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.290
It's a very good thing, isn't it?

23:23.630 --> 23:25.000
It is.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.010
<i>It's true. I can barely detect her mana.</i>

23:32.470 --> 23:34.970
<i>Her control over her mana is exceptional.</i>

23:35.810 --> 23:39.270
<i>How much has she studied at such a young age?</i>

23:39.680 --> 23:45.770
Mr. Heiter said when I can blast a hole 
in that rock, I'll be a proper mage.

23:46.190 --> 23:49.690
Oh? Heiter knows what he's 
talking about. That'sâ€”

23:55.870 --> 23:59.700
As you just saw, my magic 
dissipates and doesn't reach it.

24:00.460 --> 24:01.710
I see.

24:02.370 --> 24:05.250
What should I do to train?

24:05.590 --> 24:08.460
Can I ask you something first?

24:09.460 --> 24:10.970
Do you like magic?

24:11.760 --> 24:13.470
Somewhat.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.930
Just like me, then.

25:50.230 --> 25:53.190
Is Fern's training coming along smoothly?

25:50.230 --> 25:53.190
Are you trying to put on 
a brave face again, Heiter?

25:51.270 --> 25:53.190
It saddens me to see him treated like this.

25:53.190 --> 25:55.150
But they're worth looking for.

25:53.190 --> 25:55.150
Magic sure is amazing, isn't it?

25:53.190 --> 25:55.150
You keep collecting the strangest spells.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.740
It'd be a waste for you to die.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.780
Someday, I'd like to show them to you.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.950
Episode 2







It Didn't Have to Be Magic...

25:57.780 --> 25:59.950
It didn't have to be magic...
